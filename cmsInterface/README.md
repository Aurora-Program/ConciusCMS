## 📋 Core Components

### Gallery Navigation (`inicio.tsx`)
- Interactive image gallery with touch and keyboard navigation
- Project-based slide organization
- Mobile-responsive design with gesture support
- Dynamic content loading and transitions

### Content Editor (`Editor.tsx`)
- Rich text editing with React Quill
- Field management system
- Schema-based content structure

### State Management
- **pageSlice.ts**: Page content and navigation state
- **editorSlice.ts**: Editor state and content management
- **schemaSlice.tsx**: Dynamic schema definitions

## 🎨 Styling and Theming

The application uses a combination of:
- **CSS Modules**: Component-specific styles
- **SCSS**: Advanced styling with variables and mixins
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive grid system and components
- **Custom CSS**: Unique design elements and animations

### Key Style Files
- `src/App.css`: Global application styles
- `src/Pages/inicio.css`: Gallery and navigation styles
- `src/Editor/editor.css`: Editor interface styles
- `src/custom.scss`: Custom Bootstrap theme

## 🔧 Configuration

### TypeScript Configuration
The project uses strict TypeScript configuration with:
- Strict type checking enabled
- Module resolution for React components
- Path mapping for cleaner imports

### Vite Configuration
- React SWC for fast refresh
- Optimized build output
- Development server with HMR

### Feature flags via environment variables
The application supports a simple feature flag to enable or disable public signup from the login page:

- `VITE_ALLOW_SIGNUP` — set to `1` or `true` to show the "Crear cuenta" link on the login page; set to `0` or leave unset to hide it.

Example .env:

```text
VITE_CONTENT_BUCKET_URL=https://your-bucket-url
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api
VITE_ALLOW_SIGNUP=1
```

### About the `.env` and `.env.example` files

This project uses Vite environment variables (all starting with `VITE_`) stored in a `.env` file at the project root.

- `.env.example` (checked into the repo) documents the expected variables and contains safe example placeholders.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values for your local environment. For example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env with real values
```

- Important: Vite loads env values at startup. If you change `.env`, restart the dev server (`npm run dev`).

Security note: Do not commit secrets or production credentials to version control. Keep `.env` out of source control and only commit `.env.example`.
